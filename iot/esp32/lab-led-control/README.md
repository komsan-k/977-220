This lab integrates Wi-Fi, MQTT communication, and PWM-based dimming control for an LED using the ESP32 platform.

üåê Lab: MQTT-Based LED Control with ESP32 (Subscriber with Dimming Function)
üß© 1. Objective

The objective of this laboratory is to demonstrate MQTT-based device control through an ESP32 subscriber that receives commands to turn an LED on, off, or adjust brightness (0‚Äì100%) from an MQTT broker.

Students will learn to:

Configure ESP32 as an MQTT client and subscriber.

Implement Wi-Fi and MQTT connection routines.

Control PWM signals to vary LED brightness based on MQTT messages.

Test and visualize MQTT message control using Node-RED or HiveMQ web tools.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Background Theory
2.1 MQTT Communication

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight, publish‚Äìsubscribe messaging protocol widely used in IoT.
It allows devices to publish data or subscribe to topics through a broker.

Key Terms:

Term	Description
Broker	Central server that manages message exchange.
Topic	String identifier for message channels.
Publisher	Sends data to a topic.
Subscriber	Receives messages from a topic.
2.2 ESP32 PWM Control

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) allows control of analog-like output using digital signals.
The ESP32 provides multiple PWM channels controlled by the LED Control (LEDC) peripheral.
The duty cycle determines brightness (0‚Äì255 in 8-bit resolution).

üß© 11. Discussion

This experiment demonstrates how IoT control systems can integrate MQTT communication with hardware-level PWM to achieve remote and dynamic lighting control. The same architecture can be extended for:

Smart home automation (light dimming, fan speed).

Industrial IoT dashboards.

Cloud-controlled actuators or motors.

The key insight is how payload-based interpretation enables flexible device behavior using a single topic.
