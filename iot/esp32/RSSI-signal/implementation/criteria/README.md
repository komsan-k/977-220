## üß© 2. Completion Criteria

To be considered **complete**, your lab must meet all of the following checkpoints:

| **Checkpoint** | **Description** | **Verification Method** |
|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Compiles Successfully | No errors or missing libraries | Arduino IDE compile output |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ MQTT Connection Established | ESP32 connects to HiveMQ broker | Serial monitor shows ‚Äúconnected‚Äù |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ JSON Data Published | Temperature, LDR, and RSSI values published to topic | HiveMQ dashboard displays payload |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ RSSI Integrated | JSON payload includes `"rssi_dbm"` field | Serial log and MQTT verification |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ Serial Output Verified | RSSI and sensor data displayed correctly | Screenshot or instructor check |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ Discussion / Reflection | Student explains signal variation vs. distance | Short verbal or written summary |

## üìä 3. Example Evaluation Rubric

| **Component** | **Weight (%)** | **Description** |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Functionality | 40% | JSON payload includes LDR, Temperature, RSSI |
| MQTT Connectivity | 20% | Stable broker connection and topic publish |
| Code Quality | 20% | Clear comments, readable structure |
| Verification & Demonstration | 10% | Output verified via Serial and MQTT |
| Timeliness | 10% | Based on time checkpoint table |

## üß† Instructor Notes
- Each 15-minute interval after **10:00 AM** reduces the lab grade linearly until **12:00 PM**.  
- Early finishers (before 10:00 AM) earn **full 4%**.  
- Ensure students document proof of MQTT message and RSSI variation.  
- Encourage screenshots or short videos of HiveMQ output for bonus clarity.
